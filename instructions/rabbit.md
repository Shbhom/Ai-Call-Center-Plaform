### **Plan for Exchange Creation, Queue Creation, and Message Publishing**

---

### **1. Exchange Creation (User-Specific Exchange)**

#### **When**:
- Triggered during user registration.

#### **What**:
- Create a direct exchange for the user.

#### **How**:
1. **Name**: `{user_id}_exchange`
   - Example: For `user_id=456`, the exchange name is `456_exchange`.
2. **Type**: `direct`
   - Routes messages based on exact routing keys.
3. **Durability**: Ensure the exchange persists across RabbitMQ restarts.

#### **Key Points**:
- Declare the exchange in an idempotent manner to avoid duplication errors.
- This exchange acts as the central routing point for all agent queues under the user.

---

### **2. Queue Creation and Binding (Agent-Specific Queue)**

#### **When**:
- Triggered when an agent is created for a user.

#### **What**:
1. **Create Queue**:
   - Name: `{agent_id}_queue`
   - Example: For `agent_id=789`, the queue name is `789_queue`.
   - Make it durable so it persists across RabbitMQ restarts.

2. **Bind Queue to User Exchange**:
   - Bind the agent queue to the userâ€™s exchange.
   - **Exchange Name**: `{user_id}_exchange`
   - **Routing Key**: `{agent_id}`
     - Example: For `agent_id=789`, the routing key is `789`.

#### **Key Points**:
- Each queue is dedicated to a specific agent.
- Use a unique routing key (`{agent_id}`) to ensure precise message delivery.

### **Diagram Representation**

```
1. User Registration:
   - Create Exchange: 456_exchange

2. Agent Creation:
   - Create Queue: 789_queue
   - Bind Queue 789_queue to Exchange 456_exchange with Routing Key: 789

```

### **Summary**

- **Exchange Creation**:
  - Triggered during user registration.
  - Name: `{user_id}_exchange`, Type: `direct`, Durable: Yes.

- **Queue Creation**:
  - Triggered during agent creation.
  - Name: `{agent_id}_queue`, Durable: Yes.
  - Bound to `{user_id}_exchange` with routing key `{agent_id}`.
